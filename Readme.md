# Buck–Boost Converter for EV Applications ⚡

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and simulation of a Buck–Boost Converter** for Electric Vehicle (EV) applications. A Buck–Boost Converter is a DC-DC power electronic converter that can **step up (boost)** or **step down (buck)** input voltage depending on the requirement. In EVs, it is mainly used for:
- Battery charging and discharging control
- Maintaining stable voltage for motor controllers
- Improving overall efficiency of the powertrain

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a Buck–Boost converter capable of handling variable input voltage.
- To analyze performance parameters like efficiency, output ripple, and duty cycle.
- To simulate the converter using **MATLAB/Simulink**.
- To verify converter performance with different load conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **MATLAB/Simulink** for simulation
- **PSIM/Proteus** (optional for circuit analysis)
- **Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)** for plotting simulation data
